However, the range of freedom allowed in conducting research at iSchools sometimes poses unexpected difficulties for students. This study aims to identify the unique problems that graduate students in an interdisciplinary iSchool program encounter when designing a research project. A qualitative content analysis method is used to analyze students’ responses regarding the difficulties they have experienced. The findings indicate that the difficulties, which range from a paradox of choice in determining a research topic to communicating the implications of their research outcomes, generally point to a problem of identity formation. This study argues that students’ identity problems have been overshadowed by the hype of interdisciplinary studies and that helping students establish a solid identity within iSchool programs is necessary to produce healthy and confident researchers.},

One theme in the discussions centres on whether those iSchools, deriving from LIS programs, are indeed different from other non-iSchools of the field. To address this question, five iSchools and five non-iSchools that host the ALA-accredited master's program are compared in terms of program requirements, core courses, concentrations/specializations, and other related parameters. Few distinctive differences are observed between the two groups except for more course offerings by the iSchools and higher number of concentrations/specializations among the non-iSchools. This study also examines issues concerning the iSchool movement (e.g., exclusiveness) based on the findings obtained. Although branding is a common practice, it is the collaboration and interaction among all the schools, with or without the "i" prefix, that would truly advance the information field in general and facilitate information education in particular.},

	title = {Digital {Preservation} {Education} in {iSchools}},
	url = {https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/handle/2142/15054},
	abstract = {This poster investigates digital preservation education in the iSchool caucus. The project identifies core concepts addressed in digital preservation coursework in iSchools and identifies possible areas for curriculum development.
Digital preservation education at the graduate level is critical. To ensure long-term access and use of digital materials, information professionals must have a working knowledge of digital curation, which emphasizes a lifecycle approach to digital preservation [1]. Unfortunately, the topic of digital preservation education is not prominent in literature about digital curation. Only a handful of case studies and recommendations have been published regarding digital preservation education within information science, library science, and computer science graduate programs. Instead, much of the work on digital preservation education is contained in more general studies on educating digital librarians or electronic records managers. To understand how to better design curricula that engages central issues of digital curation at the graduate level, an investigation of the current state of digital preservation education is warranted.
Coursework devoted solely to digital preservation is essential for graduate students in information-centric disciplines. The necessity for devoted coursework is due to the complex and multifaceted nature of the topic. Unfortunately, a 2006 study found that very few library or information science schools offered courses specifically on the topic of digital preservation. Furthermore, an extremely small percentage of students in library or information science programs had exposure to the critical aspects of digital preservation during their coursework [2].
Digital preservation education can and should be studied in iSchools. The core mission of the iSchool movement is to connect people, information, and technology [3]. Digital curation supports this mission by enabling the continued maintenance of digital information resources throughout their lifecycle, allowing them to be rendered and re-used in the long-term. It is an interdisciplinary process that hinges on expertise from many different fields, including computer science, information and library science, informatics, management, and education. Furthermore, iSchools are a natural home for digital library education [4] and there are significant overlaps between digital library education and digital curation education [5]. It follows that iSchools are an excellent venue for research on the topic of digital preservation education.
This project examines digital preservation courses in iSchools over the past five years (2005-2009). Course descriptions and syllabi are examined in order to develop a definition of current practices in digital preservation education. Based on this definition, areas for future developments in digital preservation curricula are identified.
Course catalogs from the 26 iSchools have been analyzed to determine whether or not schools offer classes specifically on the topic of digital preservation. Of the 26 iSchools, 9 schools offer degrees in information science and in library science, 6 award degrees in information science but not in library science, and 5 award degrees in library science and not information science. The remaining 6 schools offer a variety of degrees, including computer science, information management, and information technology. These categories will be useful in determining what types of iSchools, if any, are leaders in digital preservation education. All of the schools that have been examined to date offer course catalogs and course descriptions on the open web. Many of the course syllabi are also available online. The course must contain the phrase “Digital Preservation” in its title or course description in order to be included. One-shot sessions and classes that deal with a subset of digital preservation, such as classes on digital libraries, are not considered.
Course themes and assignments are compared to the DigCCurr Matrix of Digital Curation Knowledge and Competencies. This six-dimensional matrix from the University of North Carolina DigCCurr project defines and organizes materials to be covered in digital curation coursework [6]. This analysis will identify current strengths and potential areas for further development in digital preservation education. The study will also address the question of where current digital preservation course materials fit within the larger scope of digital curation knowledge and competencies.},

This essay argues that such evolution is essential to our future, as iSchools tackle the increasingly complex issues confronting a digital society. We consider the mission and history of iSchools and of archival studies, the basic elements and concepts of archival studies that are critical to iSchools, and the relationship between iSchools and the changing nature of personal and institutional archives.},

Claiming to be edgy and innovative, how can and should these schools function in the spirit of assessment that now drives so much in the university? This essay, which explores how well we can assess iSchools, emerged from a doctoral seminar. Academic Culture and Practice, taught by Richard Cox and including four doctoral student participants and the Dean of School of Information Studies at the University of Pittsburgh, Ronald Larsen. The doctoral students, among other activities, were required to work on assignments to support a self-study for the University of Pittsburgh's reaccreditation by the Middle States Association. As we proceeded through the course, we found ourselves increasingly drawn to questions about how iSchools, in their nascent state, can assess themselves. Four major areas—reputation, evaluating productivity in scholarly publishing, student evaluation of teaching, and student satisfaction with their academic programs—that emerged based on student interest as the seminar proceeded are discussed.},

	abstract = {This study describes the intellectual landscape of iSchools and examines how the various iSchools map onto these research areas. The primary focus of the data collection process was on faculty members’ current research interests as described by the individuals themselves. A co-word analysis of all iSchool faculty members’ research interests was used as a research method. The relations between the current research profiles of the iSchools were compared by calculating the cosine similarity between co-word profiles and visualized in network graphs. The results show that the iSchools still contain many dominant themes from library and information science, but have an expanded conceptual landscape with the introduction of new iSchools.},

	abstract = {The questions we were asked to discuss for this 6th International Conference on Conceptions of Library and Information Science were whether there should be a unique iSchool curriculum and, if so, what would it look like? We have used a methodology in writing this paper that draws heavily on anthropological traditions of observation and analysis.
If a unique iSchool curriculum ought to exist, then an iSchool ought to be more than a library school with a name that implies modern times. Some of the differences between iSchools and the more traditional library schools are apparent in their course descriptions. Our proposed curriculum is an abstract designed around a set of ideas, not around what is implementable in the classroom. At present our interactions with computers tend to be highly verbal. Nonetheless the real communication takes place with words.
For those who like this ideal curriculum and want to try it should at a minimum retain three key principles: 1) all information services now revolve around human-computer interaction; 2) teach students to think like anthropologists and look at the problems and issues from multiple viewpoints, multiple cultures, and multiple ecologies; and 3) students need to remember that language both enables and limits our ability to communicate with contemporary information systems - without a strong awareness of linguistic issues, we cannot provide information.},

Utilizing Pawley's four paradigms that dominate research and teaching in LIS – science/technology, business/management, mission/service, and society/culture – this study analyzes the syllabi of diversity-related courses to better understand the content, context, availability, emphases, and level of these courses, as well as the paradigm into which the course fits. This study found only a small number of courses in the sample focused on diversity, and of these courses, almost all were electives that emphasized a small number of diversity topics. The analysis of the findings forms the basis for recommendations about improving the focus on and for future studies of diversity in LIS education.},

After proposing any aca-demic discipline’s six levels of abstraction, and using them to define curricular “depth,” detailed investigation reveals that IS butts against different neighboring disciplines at different levels.  Then, after proposing IS’ six sub-disciplines, they are shown not only to have different distributions across their levels of abstract-tion, but also to butt up against different neighboring disciplines.  An I-School’s role as a “professional school” is factored into this discussion.
Curricular “width” is defined as how close a curriculum should get to its near neighbors.  Then, “holes” are identified in the spaces between the I-disciplines and their neighbors.  These holes represent areas of human knowledge, which are typically ex-cluded from all the academic disciplines at most universities.  It is argued here that I-Schools should strive to fill those holes by expanding their curricular width.},
