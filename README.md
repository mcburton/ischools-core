This repository contains the data and research code for the iConference 2016 short research paper titled "Looking for the Core: Preliminary Explorations of iCaucus Syllabi"

In the `data` folder is a set of CSV files containing the citation data and lookup tables for the analysis.

In the `notebooks` folder are [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org) documenting the computational workflow. This folder contains two notebooks:
- `parsing-citations.ipynb` - contains the code for using the [AnyStyle API](http://anystyle.io/) for parsing text string citations into semi-structured data.
- `clustering courses.ipynb` - contains the code for generating the various graphs in the paper and computing the diversity of individual degree programs.

In the `writing/iconf16` folder is the LATEX documents and rendered PDF of the submission to iconf16. Let's fill this up with more research outputs!

Please open a Github issue or fork the project if you are interested in contributing to this research.
